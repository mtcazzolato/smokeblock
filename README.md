# The SmokeBlock Approach

Implementation of the work published in AMC SAC 2016:  

## Method, Input and Output
The SmokeBlock approach works in the following way. Given an input image:  
- Extract superpixel regions;  
- Classify each region using a trained Naive Bayes classifier;  
- Segment image with all regions classified as smoke;  
- Classify the segmented image using a trained global Naive Bayes classifier.  

As result, the algorithm provides:  
- A set of coordinate points, representing MBRs;  
- The mean color of all pixels classified as smoke in a MBR;  
- The "what" tag, informing 1 if image was classified as smoke, and 0 if the image was classified as non-smoke;  
- The segmented image, containing only regions classifies as smoke.  

Naive Bayes training (for superpixels):  
- The Naive Bayes classifier is trained using a dataset of feature vectors, extracted from smoke and non-smoke regions;  
- All regions are superpixels, manually classified as smoke and non-smoke.  

Naive Bayes training (for the global segmented image):  
- The Naive Bayes classifier is trained using a dataset of feature vectors, extracted from smoke and non-smoke segmented images;  

## How to use
In order to successfully work, there must be a directory "use" in the same directory of the executable file, with:  
- "use/train/features/" directory, containing the training files "training_classes.csv", "training_cl_hr.csv", "training_global_cl_hr.csv" and "training_global_classes.csv".  

There is a sample of how to use in "main.cpp" source file.  

There is also a Makefile in the main directory.  

## Last Update
Updated version: 27.05.2016  
- Added global classification using Naive Bayes;  
- Improved training features from global images (segmented);  
- Improved training features from superpixels;  
- Cleaning unused files.
